**Repository Structure:**

- **`Genome/`**: Contains genomic sequence files used for analysis.
- **`blast_output/`**: Includes output files from BLAST searches.
- **`clustal-omega-1.2.2-win64/`**: Clustal Omega for Windows.
- **`clustal_output/`**: Results of sequence alignment tasks using Clustal Omega.
- **`extracted_seqs/`**: Directory for storing extracted sequences (dna/protein) from genome in FASTA format.
- **`future_docker/`**: Reserved for Docker implementation-related files.
- **`homologs/`**: Contains homologous sequences for multialignment and phylogenetic analysis.
- **`tree_output/`**: Stores phylogenetic tree files generated during analysis.
